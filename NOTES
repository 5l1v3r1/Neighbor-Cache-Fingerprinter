===== MISC NOTES TO SELF =====


== Fingerprint tests ==

Initial ARP Mode		: [ARP First | Response First]
Initial ARP MAC Destination	: [Broadcast | Unicast]
Initial ARP Delay		: [0 | x seconds after initial response (averaged over n tests)]
Maximum Unicast ARP Tries	: n
Maximum Broadcast ARP tries	: n
Time between Unicast ARP Tries	: n (avg? What about increasing times?)
Time between Broadcast ARP	: n (avg?)

  Spoof IP/MAC and send TCP packet
	Check if we get an ARP packet first, or a response and then an ARP packet
	Handle no response
	Handle no ARP
	Don't respond to any ARP requests for these tests



Upper protocol positive feedback: [true | false]
	This will require an open TCP port. Use nmap? Specify port as input for first prototype

Stale timing with constant packets		: n
Stale timing with increasing packer intercals 	: n
	Keep sending packets, watch how often we get ARP requests

Listens to ARP broadcasts		: [true | false]
Listens to ARP broadcasts if query seen	: [true | false]
	Send ARP broadcast, then try a connection and see if it ARPs anyway

ARP table size extrapolation via flooding?
	Can we overflow the table and figure out it's size?
